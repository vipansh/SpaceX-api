## CORS is ðŸ’” Next.js is â™¥

Are you frustrated with the CORS error while using any API?

Uses Next.js API routes to get the data from the main [Github Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/positions.json) so you don't have to bang your head for CORS error.

Thanks to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) it only took 5 minutes.
